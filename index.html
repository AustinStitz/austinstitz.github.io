      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>Hi! I'm Austin Stitz! I'm a programmer, maker, and hacker who often goes by the pseudonym AmazingMech2418. I create code libraries, console applications, websites, scripts, bookmarklets, quick solutions to problems, and much more! I mostly stick to the same few programming languages, including JavaScript, Java, C++, Python, and Haskell, but know the basics of over 54 programming/markup languages. Most of what I make either solves an immediate problem or was created as a personal challenge to see if I could do it. I always like pushing the boundaries with what I make, to try to grow personally so that I can help more people in the future.</p>

      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>I have many projects featured in this portfolio website! These projects range from quick prototypes to my big programming projects to some things I made to solve immediate problems, that are maybe not the most polished. These include some projects made on Scratch, Repl.it, GitHub, and even some demonstrations of things I've actually physically built!</p>
