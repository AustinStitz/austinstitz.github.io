      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p style="line-height: 2">Hi! I'm Austin Stitz! I'm a programmer, maker, and hacker who often goes by the pseudonym AmazingMech2418. I create code libraries, console applications, websites, scripts, bookmarklets, quick solutions to problems, and much more! I mostly stick to the same few programming languages, including JavaScript, Java, C++, Python, and Haskell, but know the basics of over 54 programming/markup languages. Most of what I make either solves an immediate problem or was created as a personal challenge to see if I could do it. I always like pushing the boundaries with what I make, to try to grow personally so that I can help more people in the future.
      <br/><br/>
      My pseudonym, and username on most websites, comes from the Science Olympiad event, Amazing Mechatronics. I was introduced to Science Olympiad in 6th grade and joined my school's team, including in that specific event, which also introduced me to the Scratch website. I already knew the block coding language, but Science Olympiad gave me my first exposure to the website. The "AmazingMech" part of my username comes from the event name and the "2418" is simply random numbers, since the username AmazingMech was already taken on Scratch. The account was originally a team account, but as members started leaving and I became its only active user, and as I learned team accounts were not allowed on Scratch, my Science Olympiad coach and I decided that it would become a personal account and that future members would create their own.
      <br/><br/>
      As I started exploring GitHub, Repl.it, and other websites, I kept the username. It made it easy for people I collaborated with on Scratch to know who I was, and helped add some consistency to my online presence. Some websites, such as HackTheBox, however, limited the characters in a username to where "AmazingMech2418" wouldn't fit, so those usernames became AM2418.
      <br/><br/>
      While my journey as a maker started on Scratch, I have gone far beyond the block coding website. I have contributed to open-source projects, including the code behind Scratch itself, have created my own projects, have learned more and more about text-based programming, creating projects along the way, and have made physical projects as well. If I can make something with the materials I have that can impact other people or solve a problem, I want to do it. So, whether a solution to a school project or something with much larger implications, I try to make as much as I can.
